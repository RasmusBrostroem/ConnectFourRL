# Playing Connect Four with Reinforcement Learning (WIP!)  

_NOTE: This repository was initially created as part of an exam project,
but has recently undergone a major refactoring.  
Currently, we're in the process of documenting the project and creating

your own agents and training strategies. If you're interested, please come
back in a a month or so!_
